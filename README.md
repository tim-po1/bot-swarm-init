# bot-swarm-init

Bootstrap a fresh Ubuntu/Debian host into a working bot-swarm coordinator. One script, one sudo command at the end, you're running.

## Quick start

On the target host, as the unprivileged user that will own the swarm:

```bash
# Option A — clone the repo
git clone https://your-host/bot-swarm-init.git
cd bot-swarm-init
./init.sh

# Option B — one-shot pipe
curl -sL https://your-host/bot-swarm-init/init.sh | bash
```

Then follow the printed instructions. The whole flow:

```bash
ssh your-vps
# (run one of the install options above)
sudo loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)   # one-time; makes services survive logout
systemctl --user enable --now bot-swarm-worker.service

tmux new -s coord
cd ~/bot-swarm
claude
# Interactive auth on first run. The coord reads seeded memory at
# ~/.claude/projects/-home-<user>-bot-swarm/memory/ — knows the protocol from minute one.
```

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| `~/bot-swarm/` | Worker code + config skeleton + data dir layout |
| `~/.nvm/`, `~/.local/bin/uv`, `~/.local/bin/claude` | User-space tooling, no sudo (except linger) |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/bot-swarm-worker.service` | Worker socket daemon, auto-restart |
| `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/{MEMORY,swarm-protocol,dispatch-patterns,known-quirks,hermes-role}.md` | Distilled coord knowledge, seeded so the first Claude on this host can drive the swarm without reading source |
| `~/bin/with-tg-proxy.sh` (if `TG_PROXY_VIA_XRAY=1`) | Wrapper that routes outbound HTTP(S) through an xray container's WARP-backed HTTP-proxy inbound |

## Optional env vars

```bash
SWARM_USER=claude           # who owns the install (default: $USER)
SWARM_HOME=~/bot-swarm      # install root (default)
SWARM_PROJECT=myapp         # primary project slug — scaffolded under data/myapp/
SWARM_PROJECT_REPO=git@...  # cloned to ~/$SWARM_PROJECT if provided (greenfield)
SWARM_PROJECT_PATH=/path    # OR point at an existing repo (attach mode — won't clone or clobber)
TG_PROXY_VIA_XRAY=1         # install the proxy wrapper (needs xray-vpn container)
```

### Three project modes

| You set | Init does |
|---|---|
| `SWARM_PROJECT=foo SWARM_PROJECT_REPO=git@...` | Greenfield. Clones the repo to `~/foo` and registers it. |
| `SWARM_PROJECT=foo SWARM_PROJECT_PATH=/home/user/foo` | **Attach mode** — registers an existing repo. NEVER touches its `.git/` or `.claude/`. |
| `SWARM_PROJECT=foo` alone | Looks for `~/foo`; if present, registers as attach mode. |

## What does NOT ship

- **No project data** (PlanLink-specific work, expert memory dirs, captured Telegram corpora). The init lays down a clean swarm skeleton; you bring or grow your own project state.
- **No Telegram bridge / poller configuration** — those are project-specific. Look at the proxy-wrapper + the seed-memory's `known-quirks.md` to wire one up.
- **No Hermes integration** — see `seed-memory/hermes-role.md` for the Phase-2 stub.

## Updating

`init.sh` is idempotent — re-running it skips existing installs. To pull a newer worker:

```bash
cd bot-swarm-init && git pull
# then on the target:
rsync -aH bot-swarm-init/vendor/bot-swarm/ ~/bot-swarm/    # or re-extract
( cd ~/bot-swarm/worker && uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -e . )
systemctl --user restart bot-swarm-worker.service
```

## Provenance

Built 2026-06-11 by coord-p17 (PlanLink swarm, Mac) after driving the PlanLink build Jun 8–11. The seed-memory captures workarounds and patterns proven during that work — see `seed-memory/dispatch-patterns.md` for the orchestration patterns and `known-quirks.md` for friction we hit (and fixed, in some cases — check the bot-swarm self-project backlog for fix status).

This package is the way to bootstrap a "coord with experience" rather than a generic Claude. The next coord on the next host gets 3 days of context for free.
